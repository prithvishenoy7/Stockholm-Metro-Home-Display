# Python Dependencies for Train Departure API
# ===========================================
# CONCEPT: This file lists all Python packages needed
# pip will install these when building the Docker image

# Flask - Web framework for building APIs
# Lightweight and perfect for microservices
flask==3.0.0

# Flask-CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
# SECURITY CONCEPT: Allows ESP32 to call API from different origin/domain
# Without this, browsers would block the requests
flask-cors==4.0.0

# Requests - HTTP library for calling external APIs
# Used to fetch data from Trafiklab
requests==2.31.0

# Werkzeug - WSGI utility library (Flask dependency)
# Included explicitly for security updates
werkzeug==3.1.4

# python-dotenv - Load environment variables from .env files
# Used for local development configuration
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# pytz - Timezone library for Python
# TIMEZONE CONCEPT: Handles timezone conversions (UTC to Europe/Stockholm)
# Essential for showing correct local time in Sweden
pytz==2024.1

# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTE: Pin versions to specific numbers
# WHY? Prevents supply chain attacks and ensures reproducible builds
# Always use known-good versions, update intentionally
# ============================================

# PRODUCTION CONSIDERATION:
# For production, you'd also add:
# - gunicorn (production WSGI server, Flask's built-in server is dev-only)
# - redis (for distributed caching across multiple containers)
# - prometheus-flask-exporter (metrics for monitoring)
